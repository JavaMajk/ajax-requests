# Ajax Requests

This is a simple project using the unsplashAPI and nytimesAPI for getting requests using three different methods.
This is from part of repo for [Udacity's Ajax course](). The course covers making asynchronous requests using three different methods:

* the XHR object
* jQuery's `.ajax()` method
* the Fetch API

The same project is built with each of these techniques. You'll find one folder for each.
